# Kali Live Flow

This project contains several different build types and related scripts for Kali Linux, likely for a virtual workstation.


## live-flow for developer test

The configuration scripts and documentation for an optimized yet unstable arch-esque approach to Kali.

See `unstable-mix-dev/` for this light compiler build.

## live-flow for Kali live mode

Kali live steps I take after booting into live mode.

See `live-mode/` for running Kali from a USB device or booting in live mode.

If you make "steps" executable and run as root, it will take care of it. 
Note that a random password will be set for root and kali users for live mode!
